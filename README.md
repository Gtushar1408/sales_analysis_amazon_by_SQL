Aanalysis of the sales by using SQL


The Sales Analysis Final Project at Seattle University focuses on analyzing data from the AdventureWorks2012DW database. The objective is to provide valuable insights for the financial analyst team and executive group. The project comprises five key objectives:

Internet Sales Analysis: Prepare a detailed list of internet sales, including Category, Model, CustomerKey, Region, IncomeGroup, CalendarYear, FiscalYear, Month, OrderNumber, Quantity, and Amount, with customers categorized into "Low," "Moderate," or "High" income groups.

Reseller Sales Analysis: Similar to the internet sales analysis, provide a breakdown of reseller sales by Category, Model, CalendarYear, FiscalYear, Month, OrderNumber, Quantity, and Amount.

Total Sales by Year and Territory: Display the total sales rolled up by year for each Territory group and country. The United Kingdom's totals must be shown separately from Europe.

Sales Performance by Promotion: Analyze how different types of promotions impact sales (quantity and revenue) by product category or region, comparing Internet and Reseller sales.

Customer Analysis: Join the Customer table with Internet sales data to provide insights into customer demographics and behavior.

To present the results effectively, there are two distinct documents:

Technical Report: This Word document contains the findings for each objective, along with SQL queries and an explanation of the approach taken for each analysis.

Executive Memo: A concise one-page Word document that summarizes the approach and key conclusions, catering to the executive group.

Both documents aim to be clear, comprehensive, and reproducible, providing valuable insights to aid decision-making and strategic planning.
